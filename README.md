# What is this project

[Â© Robert Koch-Institut](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Risikogebiete_neu.html) has a page that lists all the international risk areas,
this list is useful to everyone living in Germany, but it's not easy to see which countries are present or not in this list.
